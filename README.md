# The Antique Network

> NuxtJS Client Partnership

## The Story

This site is under development.
I am in the process of rebuilding a network of sites for people who love antiques.
It's currently a PHP site that mostly works : you can visit the current form here :
[Iowa Antique Network](https://www.iowaantiquenetwork.com/)

I am rebuilding it with Nuxt and AWS - moving to a serverless architecture.
AWS Resources beinf used will include :
- Congnito
- API Gateway
- Lambda
- S3
- DynamoDB

## Here's Where I'm At

You can visit a demo of the site here :
